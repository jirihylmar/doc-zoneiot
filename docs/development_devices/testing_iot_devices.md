## Introduction Testing IoT Devices

- [ ] TODO :team_martintomis 2025-01-18 17:22:56 submit first batch of testing IoT devices to be purchased for initial development phase.

Inputs:

- [ZONEIOT Market Landscape](/development_common/zoneiot_market_landscape_ro#zoneiot-market-landscape) *refDoc*
- Meetings' discussions.
- Choice in terms of AWS Cloud Services compatibility seems to be more about manufacture (Huawei blacklist etc.) rather then particular solution. Espressif or Nordic seem to be a good choice
