## Introduction Testing IoT Devices

- [ ] TODO :team_martinlysek Thu Jan 02 16:05:21 CEST 2025 submit first batch of testing IoT devices to be purchased for initial development phase, include suggestion for procurement and configuration maintenance system.

Purchase will be done using e-shops registered account master@zoneiot.cz to keep track.

**Bottom line:** every part needs to enable automated data processing (api, shared structured data files like google sheets, ...)

Inputs:

- [ZONEIOT Market Landscape](/development_common/zoneiot_market_landscape_ro#zoneiot-market-landscape) *refDoc*
- Kick off meeting.

In this document

- Description of process and update  (eshops, vendors, +/-). The goal is to have stable partner needed assortment. Local businesses only at this point.
- Catalog, use established google sheet <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hn19guhoR5S8pZB3V2UVz7GHC-NsXhqI01vAcQzjKPE/edit?gid=0#gid=0' target='_blank'>zoneiot_testing_devices</a> all suggest other equivalent solution
- Define categories etc. component, computer, consumables, measurement, measurement_box, microcontroller, microcontroller_adapter, microcontroller_box, microcontroller_shield, power_charger, power_measurement, power_misc, power_regulator, power_source, sensor, switch_mechanical
- HW and firmware configurations maintenance suggest, reproducible to production system in future
