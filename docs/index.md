**Expert system for remote monitoring of road workplaces using IoT and advanced image processing technology**  
The project's objective is the research and subsequent development of smart components, which in their final state will form an independent system for monitoring and detecting temporary traffic signage in traffic restrictions, such as sets of signal lights, warning lights, and traffic signs in specific configurations. The system will utilize data analysis gathered from a network of sensors or images from unique cameras placed in the target area, combining and evaluating this information. The mission of the system, which will be pilot tested, is to detect the extent of damage, displacement, and the condition of traffic signage, including recording the damage event. All information about the events will be available to service organizations and third parties. See [ZONEIOT NÃ¡vrh Projektu](/governance/zoneiot_navrh_projektu_ro#zoneiot-navrh-projektu) *refDoc* for details.

To contribute, use English as the primary language. See [Template](/support/template#template) *refDoc*.
